Problem statement: 
The velocity is equal to the rate of change of distance x (m). 

dx/dt = v(t) 

(a) Substitute in Eq. (1.10) and develop an analytical solution for distance as 
a function of time. Assume that x(0) = 0. 

(b) Use Euler's method to numerically integrate Eqs. (P1.17) and (1.9) in order to
determine both the velocity and distance fallen as a function of time for the first 
10 s of free-fall using the same parameters as in example 1.2. 

(c) Develop a plot of your numerical results together with the analytical solution.
